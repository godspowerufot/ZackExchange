                  What is Crytocurrency?
                </p>
                This is a seemingly simple question, but since most people
                answer about what they think, hope, or want cryptocurrencies to
                be, it is a confusing one. Cryptocurrencies are a digital asset
                that started as a medium of exchange for people to buy goods and
                services. Over time, their functionality has expanded.

                  How are cryptocurrency transactions recorded?
                </p>
                Cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a shared, digital
                ledger called a blockchain. This is decentralized technology,
                spread across many computers, that records every transaction.

                  Are blockchain and cryptocurrencies the same?
                </p>
                No. Blockchain is the technology that allows for
                cryptocurrencies to work. It is a decentralized and digital
                ledger of transactions used for cryptocurrencies and other
                assets/functions. It is important to separate the technology
                behind cryptocurrencies from the actual cryptocurrencies.out

                  What is a crypto wallet?
                </p>{" "}
                simply put, crypto wallets are places to store digital assets
                more securely than just on an exchange. You hold your wallet via
                an exchange account, custody wallet, or outside of the exchange.
